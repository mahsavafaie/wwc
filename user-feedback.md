Here you can provide user feedback for winter semester sessions of Wwc.

## Comments
* Great course and very helpful and patient teachers. Will have to practise more on my own to be able to apply everything we've learned.
* The instructors were really trying to get us things done.
* The jupyter notebooks were a good thing to concentrate on the essentials of Python.
* It jumped straight into the useful stuff in a way that's useful for beginners and intermediates alike. I liked the "learning by doing" aspect.

What I found in this course: 

* Highly interactive sessions
* Practical material 
* Brilliant teachers

## Suggestions

Now it would be helpful for me to learn working with Python locally without the notebooks.

Would be great if we could have some hands-on sessions on Bash  :)
