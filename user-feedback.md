## Comments

The instructors were really trying to get us things done.
The jupyter notebooks were a good thing to concentrate on the essentials of Python.
It jumped straight into the useful stuff in a way that's useful for beginners and intermediates alike. I liked the "learning by doing" aspect.

## Suggestions

Now it would be helpful for me to learn working with Python locally without the notebooks.
